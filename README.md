# AI for Global Challenges 🌍🤖

This repository contains coursework and experiments for the **AI for Global Challenges** module.  
It focuses on applying machine learning methods to real-world sustainability and development problems.

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this work is to **replicate and critically assess** a published AI study linked to sustainable development.  
It combines **technical replication** (code, data, models) with a **critical written analysis** of the research design.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with code for data analysis and model replication.  
- Use of **scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib** for ML workflows and visualizations.  
- Critical evaluation of:
  - Dataset balance and representativeness.  
  - Model performance and fairness considerations.  
  - Implications for sustainable development goals (SDGs).
